## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JSON

### What I learned

I struggled to get the data to populate dynamically, and so my original solution had three different HTML files for daily, weekly, and monthly data. I finally realized that the problem stemmed from using 'timeFrames' instead of 'timeframes' when trying to access the required data. This was a good lesson in how important it is to make sure you are using the correct spelling and grammar when programming.
